        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          In Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Colleen Hess dies a horrific death in a
          traffic accident. After the accident, her minister husband Graham
          denounces his faith and his vocation to work full-time on his farm.
          His brother Merrill, a former minor-league baseball player known more
          for his batting brawn than his finesse, moves into the farmhouse to
          help Graham look after his two adolescent children, asthmatic son
          Morgan and daughter Bo, who has a finicky taste for water. Six months
          after the accident, crop circles appear in Graham's cornfield. They
          initially speculate that local trouble-making youths could be the
          culprits, but they learn that theirs is only one of a number of crop
          circles made simultaneously worldwide. In addition, animals have been
          acting erratically. Morgan and Bo seem to have a better sense of what
          is happening than the adults. Based on other evidence, the family
          slowly begins to believe that the crop circles are only one of many
          signs being sent by extraterrestrials. Not knowing whether the
          extraterrestrials are friendly or not, the Hesses take extreme
          precautions to protect themselves. Graham also begins to believe that
          nothing that happens is by chance, and that everything has a reason.
