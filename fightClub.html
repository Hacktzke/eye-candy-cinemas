        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          A young urban professional who works for a major car manufacturer
          can't sleep. Although he doesn't have any of the associated
          afflictions, he stumbles across support groups as a means to let out
          whatever emotions he is feeling, which in turn allows him to sleep.
          But the use of these support groups is ruined when he meets a young
          woman named Marla Singer, who is also going to all these support group
          meetings. Because he knows she too is not afflicted with any of the
          maladies for which the groups exist, her presence has lessened the
          impact of the stories he hears. His life changes when he meets a soap
          manufacturer named Tyler Durden, who in many ways is the antithesis of
          the insomniac. Due to unusual circumstances with his own condo, the
          insomniac moves in with Tyler, who lives in a large dilapidated house
          in an otherwise abandoned part of town. After a bit of spontaneous
          roughhousing with Tyler in a bar parking lot, the insomniac finds it
          becomes a ritual between the two of them, which helps him cope with
          the other more difficult aspects of his life. The fights also attract
          a following, others who not only want to watch but join in.
          Understanding that there are other men like them, the insomniac and
          Tyler begin a secret fight club. As the fight club's popularity grows,
          so does its scope in all aspects. Marla becomes a circle not
          specifically of the fight clubs but of Tyler and the insomniac's
          collectives lives. As the nature of the fight clubs becomes out of
          control in the insomniac's view, the insomniac's life, in association,
          is one where he no longer understands what is happening around him, or
          how he can get out of it without harming himself.
