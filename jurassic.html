        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          On Isla Nublar, a new park has just been built with genetically
          engineered dinosaurs. Tragedy strikes when one of the workers is
          killed by a velociraptor. The founder of the park, John Hammond, (Sir
          Richard Attenborough) requests Paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam
          Neill) and his assistant, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to come to
          the park and ensure that it is safe. Also joining them are Hammond's
          lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) and chaotician Dr. Ian Malcolm
          (Jeff Goldblum). When they reach the island, they are amazed to
          discover that Hammond has created living dinosaurs. However, at the
          same time, they all have their doubts. Later, Hammond's grandchildren
          Lex and Tim (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello) join the group in a
          tour of the park. Sattler leaves the tour to take care of an ill
          triceratops. Soon the power in the park is shut down by computer
          systems geek Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), who wishes to steal embryos
          from the park to sell to a secret buyer. In the process, many
          dinosaurs escape their paddocks, including the deadly Tyrannosaurus
          Rex, who, during a thunderstorm, escapes his paddock and attacks the
          children, and eats Gennaro. Malcolm is injured and Grant and the
          children are then lost in the park. Meanwhile, Hammond, Sattler, and
          the rest of the operations team learn that Nedry (who in the meantime
          has been killed) has locked up the computer system to cover his
          tracks. They attempt to get power back in the park in order to escape
          the island. After shutting down the system, then restoring it, the
          group realizes that velociraptors are also on the loose, and are now
          on the hunt for the visitors. <cite>- Ahmetkozan IMDb</cite>
