        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in space in an attempt
          to ensure humanity's survival. In the near future around the American
          Midwest, Cooper, an ex-science engineer and pilot, is tied to his
          farming land with his daughter Murph and son Tom. As devastating
          sandstorms ravage Earth's crops, the people of Earth realize their
          life here is coming to an end as food begins to run out. Eventually
          stumbling upon a N.A.S.A. base near Cooper's home, he is asked to go
          on a daring mission with a few other scientists into a wormhole
          because of Cooper's scientific intellect and ability to pilot aircraft
          unlike the other crew members. In order to find a new home while Earth
          decays, Cooper must decide to either stay, or risk never seeing his
          children again in order to save the human race by finding another
          habitable planet. Murphy's law suggests that "whatever can go wrong,
          will go wrong." This movie plays with the idea of space exploration,
          time, and gravity, as Earth and the human race is on the verge of
          extinction. N.A.S.A.'s last hope looks to Coop, Brand, Romilly, and
          TARS under the direction of Professor Brand to search for answers in
          the deepest corners of space while dealing with Murphy's Law. Coop
          leaves behind his family in search of new horizons as Writer,
          Producer, and Director Christopher Nolan explores the eternal bonds of
          love between a father and his daughter.<cite> - Jwelch5742 IMDb</cite>
