        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The story revolves around three families from Verona. The Ruling
          House, the House of Capulet from where Juliet hails and that of
          Montague, the male protagonist's family. The story commences with a
          street brawl fired by the feud between the Montague and Capulet
          families. When the Prince of Verona announces that any further feud
          would result in punishment, Count Paris of the ruling house expresses
          his desire to marry Juliet, from the House of Capulet, who is only
          thirteen. Meanwhile, after the brawl, Benvolio learns about Romeo's
          lost-love Rosaline, one of Lord Capulet's nieces. The estranged
          meeting between Romeo and Juliet takes place at the ball arranged for
          Count Paris to meet Juliet. Romeo meets and falls head-over-heels in
          love with Juliet. Romeo discloses his identity to her on being
          'encouraged in love'. They seek the support of Friar Laurence, who
          longs for a reconciliation between the two families and are secretly
          married. Tybalt, Juliet's cousin challenges Romeo to a duel on
          discovering that he had sneaked into the ball. However, because of
          Juliet, Romeo refuses to fight him and calls on the ire of Mercutio,
          who accepts the duel instead of Romeo. When Mercutio is wounded in the
          duel, Romeo shoots Tybalt dead and is exiled for the latter's death.
          Juliet's grief is worsened when Lord Capulet makes plans for her
          wedding with Count Paris. She seeks help from Friar Laurence. The plan
          they come up with is that Juliet would consume a drug that would take
          her into a coma for nearly two days. Romeo was to be informed of the
          plan via a messenger, who doesn't reach him in time. On the eve of her
          marriage to Count Paris, Juliet takes the drug and is declared dead.
          Romeo hears about her 'death' and buys poison before visiting the
          family crypt. Fate has other plans as Paris encounters Romeo and is
          killed by the latter. Believing that his lady love is dead, Romeo
          drinks the poison. When Juliet awakes to discover Romeo's corpse, she
          uses Tybalts gun and shoots herself in the head. The families meet at
          the tomb and hear the story of the lovers from the friar. They
          reconcile and the violent feud is declared over. The exact date when
          William Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet remains unknown. Though
          there is mention about an 'earthquake 11 years ago', the dialogue
          highlights the earthquake in England in 1580. Hence, the popular
          belief is that the play was written in 1591. The dramatic techniques,
          paradigm shifts from hope to despair and then again rejuvenated hope
          adds emotion to the verse and strain of thought in prologue.
